# ML From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of **machine learning fundamentals from scratch using Python**, with a focus on understanding the core mathematics and optimization techniques behind common algorithms — without relying on high-level ML libraries.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in machine learning by manually implementing algorithms and visualizing their behavior.

Currently included:
- Linear model trained using **Gradient Descent**
- Custom cost function (Mean Squared Error)
- Manual gradient computation
- Model training without `sklearn`
- Best-fit line visualization on noisy data
- Prediction on unseen input

## 📊 Dataset

- Synthetic dataset inspired by diabetes-related data
- Single feature: **BMI**
- Target: **Diabetes progression score**
- 200 data points with **medium noise** to simulate real-world conditions

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- How gradient descent works internally
- Effect of learning rate on convergence
- Why normalization and scaling matter
- Difference between fitting data and minimizing global error
- How noisy data affects regression lines

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Visualization

The regression line is plotted over the dataset to show how the model learns the underlying trend despite noise.

## 🚀 How to Run
